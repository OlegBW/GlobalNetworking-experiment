# Global Networking experiment

![](./src/connections-2099068_1280.png)

## Example

I want to try to test the search for people by some criteria based on the theory of 6 handshakes

For example, I need to find people who speak English, I write to you and let's say 4 more people

The question is whether you know English, and please pass the information on to your acquaintances and so on

In the end, if you consider that each person will pass the baton will come out something like this:

5 -> 125 -> 625 -> 3125 -> 15625

And that's only five steps !
___
## Why do I think it can work:

As a unit of the worldwide network I have visibility only around me, limited information, but if we start communicating the information as I say we do, we're scaling audiences coolly and in addition more accurately reaching closed groups of people by this criterion
___

## The idea is simple :


* ### Green dot - you

* ### Blue dots - other network members (people)

* ### Red dots - people in the network who fall under a certain criterion

* ### Solid arrow - request to a person

* ### Dotted line - hypothetical environment of the person to whom the request is made

### Usually, when searching for people of a certain criterion, we turn to the available environment, but in this task it is somewhat irrational because we need to have the largest possible sample

### But if each network node (person) relays the request to its environment, the number of people surveyed will grow exponentially, which significantly expands the sample. The larger the system, the more advantages retransmission will provide

#### *Duplicate requests are not displayed
___
## Purpose of the experiment

### The main purpose of the experiment is to test such a system of relaying requests as a way of effective self-organization of people or searching for like-minded people / people according to a certain criterion 
___
## How to participate

### Pass this information to people from your environment (preferably those who are really interested in the result of the experiment), if the person who received the letter is a programmer, you need to send a letter of any content to the mail: 
```sh
...
``` 
### and in any case continue the retransmission. This is necessary to summarize the overall statistics. It would be good if the country of the participant was indicated in the letter to reflect the distribution of the retransmission, but it is not necessary.

___
### All information received will be confidential, the results of the experiment will be made publicly available
